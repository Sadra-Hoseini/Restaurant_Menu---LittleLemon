# LittleLemon

LittleLemon is a simple restaurant menu website which was the final project of my Django Coursera course.

In this website you can see menu items with their description,opening hours of the restaurant and book a table for yourself.In this project I used ready-made templates for the front-end part and Django,Python and Mysql for the back-end part.

You can watch this website by using the command  $ pip install -r requirements.txt to install necessary packages.
